# FlowerClassification
A flower classification model  that uses deep neural networks (CNN) to classify 5 different types of flowers. 
The classifier uses a convolutional deep neural network which is based on Google's Inception model. The bottleneck layer has been altered for this model. The library used is the popular machine learning library TensorFlow. A series of docker commands are also included which need to be run prior to the program.
